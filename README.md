#Landing Page Wizard

The Landing Page Wizard is an application written for [HCA](http://hcahealthcare.com)'s Florida Division to showcase all of the campaign pages and microsites that we make. It is essentially a gallery with some filtering capability. It is built in [AngularJS](http://angularjs.org/), using [angular-seed](https://github.com/angular/angular-seed) as a quick start.

SASS and JS are compiled and minified on save using Gulp. A live version can be published to Github Pages via Gulp `npm run gh-pages`. All of the essential Gulp tasks are pointed to in package scripts to refrain from forcing anyone to do a global install of Gulp.

This application requires A LOT of screenshots, so we have also written a Gulp task to handle grabbing all of those as well: `npm run screenshots`. Be sure to have ImageMagick installed before running this.
